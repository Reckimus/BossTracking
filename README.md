# BossTracking
Boss GPS system

Install BepInEx 5 (x64) (If you havent already)

Download the latest “BepInEx_x64_5.xx.xx.zip” from the official GitHub releases.

Extract the contents into your Erenshor game folder (you should end up with Erenshor/BepInEx/, winhttp.dll, etc.).

Put BossTracker.dll and HUDArrow.png in Erenshor/BepInEx/plugins/

When in game if you have (BepInEx Config Manager, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) press F1 to bring up settings 
You can change arrow and text size. Smoothing settings (recommended value is 1.5 for smooth lerping of the arrow with no grid snapping)
Scan Interval default: 5 seconds which is fine and doesnt hurt performance
Arrow can be dragged with the middle mouse button.

Boss Arrow tracks all world bosses and dungeon bosses in a zone and points you to the closest one.
Chat notifies you what bosses are currently spawned and which boss is being tracked, it also notifies you when a boss has spawned so youre 
never left wondering. When no bosses are present the arrow disappears to avoid screen clutter.
